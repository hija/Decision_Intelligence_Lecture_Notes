## 00 Using Data And Technology
Data = Better Memory, but data can be false or useless (data means better memory, not more objectivity!)

AI = based on data
Data = based on humans

Collected data --> Human chose --> It might have a bias

## 01 Better Questions
Analytics = Taking a look at information FAST!
--> Allows you to ask better questions, since you have another "sensory" (e.g. it helps to know due to data that there might be a correlation)

Analytics != Decision Making

## 02 Data Driven Decisions
Data Driven = The data drives the decision! 

Problem: You must not look into the data before asking the question, because otherwise the decison can be data inspired at most (Confirmation Bias!)
Problem: Decision-makers often use data to feel better about the decision they were going to do anyway.

Use Train-Test-Split for Finding the Question (Test Set) and Answering the Question (Train Set)!

## 03 Better Answers
1. What would you do without any further information? (Selecting the default action)
2. What would you do with any information you wanted?
 
Then describe the universe in which you want to take your default action and in which you would choose another universe.
What would it take you to convince you to not select the default action? If you have full information, then answer it.

Probably you don't have all the information you want, but only partial information --> You have uncertainty! A Statistician helps balancing the probability of doing the wrong decision.

## 04 Decision Automation

> Data Science is the discipline of making data useful

* How many decisions do i want to do in this situation?
  * Many: ML / AI --> Automate Decisions!
  * Few: Statistics
  * Unknown: Analytics
  * I know already the decision: Story Telling, Persuading
