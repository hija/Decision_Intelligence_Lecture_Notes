# 00 The most important lesson
Decision != Outcome

Decision = Irrevocable allocation of resources
Outcome = How things turn out later (Quality of Decision + Randomness/"Luck")

**Important** Don't judge a decision by its outcome, but only by the information which was available when the decision was made. Otherwise, there is the risk of hindsight bias and outcome bias.
It's possible to make a good decision and have an outcome that's not so good as a result.

## 01 Dangers of outcome bias

To judge a decision, look at what was known when the decision was made. Don't "just see how things turn out before we judge it"

 > If you hold things that people couldn't possibly have known against them, that's like penalizing decision makers for not having a crystal ball, neither fair nor particularly smart in terms of evaluating decision ability.

## 02 Complex vs Simple Decision 

Decisions are easier if...

 * there are fewer options (yes and no is easier than 10 options to choose from)
 * there is an obvious winner (e.g. eating an apple vs eating a stone)
 * the decision has low impact
 * there is a clear objective for the decision
 * the cost of a decision is low (low cost to do the decision, carry out and to reverse the decision)
 * the decision is reversible
 * it doing it requires less effort (little mental load)
 * it does not trigger you emotionally
 * it causes no pressure
 * all information is available and reliable (more information is better than less information)
 * timing does not matter (you can take your time to do the decision)
 * it is an isolated decision (no one else is involved)
 * there are no internal conflicts (studying vs playing outside)

Risk = Knowing the Probabilities, Ambiguity = Not knowing the Probabilties 

## 03 Set a Goal

Think about **priorities** (what do you not care about what other people do care about? Filter them out!) and **opportunities**.

Problems with setting good goals:
1. Too concrete (Risk of overfocusing, harming yourself during the process)
2. Too vague

Outcome Goals = The win, you are actually interested in (can be vague even not fully in your control)

Performance Goals = Measurable, and mostly under your control

Process Goals = Measurable and fully under your control

Never allow your Process Goal to become the most imporant one; it is only there to serve the outcome goal. Example: Goal is to become healthy this year. Process goal is running 45 minutes per day. If you realize you are hurting yourself with this process goal, throw the goal away and choose another one which serves your outcome goal (e.g. swim 30 minutes per day)
