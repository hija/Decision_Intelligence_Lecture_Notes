# 00 The most important lesson
Decision != Outcome

Decision = Irrevocable allocation of resources
Outcome = How things turn out later (Quality of Decision + Randomness/"Luck")

**Important** Don't judge a decision by its outcome, but only by the information which was available when the decision was made. Otherwise, there is the risk of hindsight bias and outcome bias.
It's possible to make a good decision and have an outcome that's not so good as a result.

## 01 Dangers of outcome bias

To judge a decision, look at what was known when the decision was made. Don't "just see how things turn out before we judge it"

 > If you hold things that people couldn't possibly have known against them, that's like penalizing decision makers for not having a crystal ball, neither fair nor particularly smart in terms of evaluating decision ability.

## 02 Complex vs Simple Decision 

Decisions are easier if...

 * there are fewer options (yes and no is easier than 10 options to choose from)
 * there is an obvious winner (e.g. eating an apple vs eating a stone)
 * the decision has low impact
 * there is a clear objective for the decision
 * the cost of a decision is low (low cost to do the decision, carry out and to reverse the decision)
 * the decision is reversible
 * it doing it requires less effort (little mental load)
 * it does not trigger you emotionally
 * it causes no pressure
 * all information is available and reliable (more information is better than less information)
 * timing does not matter (you can take your time to do the decision)
 * it is an isolated decision (no one else is involved)
 * there are no internal conflicts (studying vs playing outside)

Risk = Knowing the Probabilities, Ambiguity = Not knowing the Probabilties 

## 03 Set a Goal

Think about **priorities** (what do you not care about what other people do care about? Filter them out!) and **opportunities**.

Problems with setting good goals:
1. Too concrete (Risk of overfocusing, harming yourself during the process)
2. Too vague

Outcome Goals = The win, you are actually interested in (can be vague even not fully in your control)

Performance Goals = Measurable, and mostly under your control

Process Goals = Measurable and fully under your control

Never allow your Process Goal to become the most imporant one; it is only there to serve the outcome goal. Example: Goal is to become healthy this year. Process goal is running 45 minutes per day. If you realize you are hurting yourself with this process goal, throw the goal away and choose another one which serves your outcome goal (e.g. swim 30 minutes per day)

## 04 Value of clairvoyance

Clairvoyance = Helps you think about how much effort, information, and data to put towards your decision

Don't overspend or underspend on a decision!

1. Visualize the scenarios (best outcome, worst outcome)
2. How much would you pay for the perfect information on effort, information and data? Value is low => Use intuition, otherwise => Use time to make a great decision

When to rely on intuition? Stakes are low, Time Pressure, Expertise (you know the stuff already)

## 05 The hackable human

Humans are limited by their biological factors (low blood sugar, less sleep etc.) + there are heuristics and biases!

--> Prehack yourself!
--> Prevent the decision if you aren't in a good condition (e.g. you had not enough sleep), try to make it later

Principle Agent Problem = Conflicting priorities between Owner (Longterm you) and Agent (Shortterm you) who runs the business --> Create constraints on the agent (shortterm you)
e.g. Create the rule to not eat two candies without having a 10 minute break between them

## 06 Decisiveness
Why are people not decivise?
* Bad habits
* Distracted by lower priority decisions --> Be intentional with your priorities
* Grief + Emotions --> Just choose the best decision, even if there are only "bad" decisions - execute and move on. Don't grief
* All options are similiar value --> Flip a coin or sth.

## 07 Confirmation Bias
What you already believe, impacts how you see and process information!
+ Framing (How information is presented)
Don't use data too just support what you already believe
