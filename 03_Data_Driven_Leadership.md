## 00 Group Decisions
Advantages:
* Protects against individual blind spots
* Balance extreme tendencies
* Protect against biological factors (being sleepy)
* Guardrails against unwise decisions
* Balance individual incentives

Disadvantages:
* Increases difficulty of making a decision
* Increases time it takes to make a decision
* Lose independence (Risk that the loudest voice influences the decision too much)
* Diffusion of responsibility

--> Limit the number of people, bc the more people there are the higher their skill must be

> Is the group making a decision or ratifying a decision?

Find out **who the true decision-makers are**!

## 01 What would it take to change your mind?
"What would it take to change your mind?"
 * Is there a decision on the table? (bc if the mind cannot be changed, there is no decision to do)
 * Get their default action
 * Get their metrics + criteria
"How scared are you?"
"How important is the decision?"
"How bad would it be if we just toss a coin?"

## 02 Culture of Decision of Intelligence
"Without data you're just a person with an opinion"
Problem: With data you are still a person with an opinion --> There is a lot of subjectivity 

-> Spot a Data Charlatan
* Do they documented how they are going to make their decision before looking into the data?

Tap the break if data is misued (data inspired etc.) and accelerate if there are data-driven approaches

## 03 Barriers to organizational decision-making
* Data Illiteracy
* Lack of Skill
* Lack of Advocacy
* Responsibility spread unwisely
* Lagging overall investment (in people, data, infrastructure)
* Misaligned incentives
* Whole mess of power and status

## 04 Deliver Value
* Find out who the decision-makers are
* Understand priorities of decision-makers
* Understand data sources of decision-makers
* What would it take to change their mind?
* Which decisions are done repeatedly --> ML / AI?
